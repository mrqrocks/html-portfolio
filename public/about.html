<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi I'm Mike, or Michael happy with either name, I have recently moved to the Southport to start a family with my partner. I have knowledge of software, hardware and peripherals learnt by completing Google's IT fundamentals and my grandad who taught me some html, basic and how to build PC's and install software, I always like to think outside the box and have a creative mind with qualifications in BTEC's in Art and Design, Media and Performing Arts. In my free time I love playing online games with freinds, photography, cooking and spending time with my partner and son.
